CognIoT utilities for configuration and debugging setups.

To check the configuration of the Pi, from within the utilities folder, type 

    ./cogniot-debug.sh

And send the resulting file to support@bostintechnology.com. This will create a tar file of the various bits of configuration that can be used by Bostin Technology to diagnose issues.

To automatically configure the Pi, from within the utilities folder, type

    ./congniot-setup.sh

This will attempt to automatically configure the Pi for the correct use of the serial ports.
